Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}), 0.06400409626216078), (Document(page_content='Resources:\\n1.

       "\"The main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system, namely planning, memory, and tool use, interact with each other in a cohesive manner to enable autonomous behavior. \\n\\n1. Planning: The agent utilizes planning to break down complex tasks into smaller subgoals for efficient handling. This involves task decomposition, where the agent can utilize techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts to transform big tasks into manageable steps. Additionally, the agent can engage in self-reflection to refine strategies based on past actions, thereby improving the quality of its decision-making and task execution.\\n\\n2. Memory: The agent's memory plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous behavior. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, allowing the agent to adapt and learn from immediate experiences. Long-term memory, on the other hand, enables the retention and recall of vast amounts of information over extended periods. This is often achieved through an external database that records the agent's experiences in natural language, facilitating inter-agent communication and triggering new statements.\\n\\n3. Tool use: The agent learns to utilize external tools like APIs for accessing additional information not present in its model weights. This can include real-time data, code execution capabilities, and proprietary information sources. By leveraging these external resources, the agent can enhance its problem-solving abilities and decision-making processes. \\n\\nOverall, the interaction between planning, memory, and tool use components allows the LLM-powered autonomous agent system to effectively handle tasks, learn from experiences, and make informed decisions autonomously.\""

       "'Task decomposition for LLM agents involves breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals. This process enables LLM-powered autonomous agents to efficiently handle complex tasks by dividing them into smaller steps. Task decomposition can be achieved through various methods, such as prompting the LLM with specific instructions like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ,\" using task-specific instructions tailored to the nature of the task, or incorporating human inputs to guide the decomposition process.\\n\\nOne common technique for task decomposition is the Chain of Thought (CoT), which prompts the model to \"think step by step\" and decompose hard tasks into simpler steps. Another approach, the Tree of Thoughts, extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step, creating a tree structure of thought steps and generating multiple thoughts per step. This allows for a more comprehensive breakdown of the problem into manageable components.\\n\\nAdditionally, the LLM+P approach involves outsourcing the planning step to an external classical planner, which utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to describe the planning problem. In this process, the LLM translates the problem into \"Problem PDDL,\" requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \"Domain PDDL,\" and then translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. This method is common in certain robotic setups but may not be applicable in all domains.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition for LLM agents is a crucial aspect of their operation, enabling them to tackle complex tasks effectively by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subgoals.'"
